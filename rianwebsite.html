    <p>Hi! My name is Avirian Candra Boul.</p>
    <p>
        I currently working for 
        <a href="https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwiTur66pY3yAhVUMSsKHdBxAMgYABAAGgJzZg&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESQOD2oorP1cE0KnRxtnkLEMdOQagVlLeTcPBUBkKm6x39bbr_FTsiT2xyfYt89GXI7Te1GbEzmBSqDYJxhX4gGp0&sig=AOD64_141JwUDXIGm4Ahp5Bc9viA98Qkng&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwiA77S6pY3yAhWQ8HMBHdtACfIQ0Qx6BAgCEAE">KYNDRYL</a>
        , a conversational real estate leasing AI, independently from 2017 and with the help of
        <a href="https://www.appfolio.com/blog/2019/01/appfolio-acquires-advanced-artificial-intelligence-technology-provider-to-expand-service-offerings/">AppFolio</a>
