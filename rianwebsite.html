    <p>Hi! My name is Avirian Candra Boul.</p>
    <p>
        I currently working for
        <a href="https://www.ibm.com/kyndryl">KYNDRYL</a>
        , a conversational real estate leasing AI, independently from 2017 and with the help of
        <a href="https://www.appfolio.com/blog/2019/01/appfolio-acquires-advanced-artificial-intelligence-technology-provider-to-expand-service-offerings/">AppFolio</a>
         since January 2019. I spend my time at the intersection of ML and product, trying to integrate them seamlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previously, I have several engineering intern at
        <a href="https://www.telkom.co.id/">Telkom Indonesia</a>

        , traveling, enjoy cooking (and eating), and follow the stonks space. In the past I've enjoyed
         football, tennis, badminton, table tennis, hiking, guitar, and probably a few other things.
